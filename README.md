#  2DMON

A fully handcrafted 2D Java adventure game built entirely from scratch.
This project showcases custom game logic, a multi-map storyline, interactable items, combat mechanics, puzzle-solving, and a dynamic lighting system.

Note: Some visual assets are sourced from Pokémon and other creators across the internet. Full credit is provided below.

 #  📖 Storyline

You begin your journey as an adventurer exploring mysterious lands.
Your progression spans across four unique maps:

Map 1 – The Discovery

Collect essential objects scattered throughout the map to unlock entry into the Dark Cave.

Map 2 – The Dark Cave

The cave starts completely dark. As soon as you find the Torch, visibility gradually increases.
Inside the cave you must:

Find the Torch

Collect the Sword

Solve a puzzle to escape

Map 3 – The Monster Grounds

Face small monsters, collect the Fireball ability, and use it to defeat enemies within a 4-tile attack range.

Map 4 – The Final Showdown

With all your collected equipment, face the Final Boss and finish your journey.
